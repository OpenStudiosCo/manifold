- Currently convert raster images into vectors using Potrace
- Fabric.JS as an interactive canvas

There's a lot to come, but more info can be found in my blog posts about this project: 
- [My angel is the manifold](https://medium.com/@mail_59849/my-angel-is-the-manifold-d0b718d03071)
  - My initial attempt to define what Manifold is meant to be.
- [Creating good tools for a brave new world](https://medium.com/@mail_59849/creating-good-tools-for-a-brave-new-world-a85fa2da43cf)
  - A broad discussion of graphics design software and how Manifold can create shortcuts in the design process using pre-modelled "macros"
